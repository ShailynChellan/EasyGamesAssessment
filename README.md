# EasyGamesAssessment

This is my submission for my assessment as for EasyGames Pty.
This repository consists of:
- The main solution done on Visual Studio using C#, CSS and JavaScript.
- The database which was made using MS SQL Server (Developers Edition) and managed using SQL Server Management Studio 2021.
 *Please note that this is not required but I figured that I would add it incase, but the email contains the script already*
- The .sql file that contains all the used queries.

I have also installed some additional packages to help with the making of the web application, these include:
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools

After reviewing my attempt, you may have noticed that I didn’t include Dapper or stored procedures in the project. This was an intentional choice based on my current familiarity and understanding with the concepts.  I prioritized building out the core features and ensuring the application was stable and met all the key requirements and I was sucessfully able to implement the user interface, along with the sorting and filtering functionality.

As for Dapper and stored procedures, I realized that my limited experience with them could affect the quality and stability of the project. Rather than risk introducing errors and issues arising, I decided to hold off on integrating them for now. Instead, I’ve created a separate version of the project where I’m actively learning and experimenting with both Dapper and stored procedures. This will allow me to apply them more confidently and effectively in future projects.

Overall, this was a very enjoyable experience as I brushed on topics and picked up different views and ideas on concepts that I didnt have prior, while also gaining knowledge in aspects I didnt have prior either.
